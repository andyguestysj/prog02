### Exercise 1
1. Colours are often represented using a scheme called ‘RGB’. With RGB we specify how much red, green
and blue makes up a colour. 
2. In VSCode create a new Java programme called `RGBColours`
3. To make a new class - Select the `src` folder and right click, select `New File`. The file should be called `X.java` where `X` is the name of the class you want to create. You should put each class you create in a different file.
4. Make a `Colour` (filename `Colour.java`, remember case matters) class which can hold red, green and blue ints and use it to create objects to represent three colours:  

|Colour|Red|Green|Blue|
|---|---|---|---|
|Yellow|255|255|0|
|Purple|128|0|128|
|Orange|255|165|0|
