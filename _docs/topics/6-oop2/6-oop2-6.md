## Inheritance

The principle of inheritance lets us create parent/child relationships between classes.

We can create a generic *parent* class and base specialised *child* classes on it. The *child* classes **inherit** the member variables and class methods of its *parent* class.

```java
public class Animal {
  public String name; // The animal's name e.g. "Bob"
  public String type; // The animal's type e.g. "Badger"
  public String eats; // What it likes to eat "Worms"

  public Animal(String name, String type, String eats){
    this.name = name;
    this.type = type;
    this.eats = eats;
  }

  public void run() {
    // make the animal run
  }
}

public class Ape extends Animal {

  public void climb() {
    // make the ape climb.
  }
}
```

The `Ape` class above has the *name*, *type* and *eats* member variables and the constructor method from its *parent* class `Animal`.  

> We sometimes also call parent classes *super classes* and the child classes *subclasses*.  

### Polymorphism And Overloading Methods

The methods inherited from a parent class can be overloaded like any other method.  

```java
public class Animal {
  public String name; // The animal's name e.g. "Bob"
  public String type; // The animal's type e.g. "Badger"
  public String eats; // What it likes to eat "Worms"
  public Image  picture;

  public Animal(String name, String type, String eats){
    this.name = name;
    this.type = type;
    this.eats = eats;
  }

  public void run(){
    // do some running stuff
  }
}

public class Dog extends Animal {
  public boolean collar; // Does the dog have a collar

  public void run(){
        // do different doggy specific running stuff here!
  }
}
```

Three things you can do with methods and inheritance.  

* **Add a new method**
* **Replace a method**
* **Extend a method**

```java
public class A {

  public void foo() {
    // do some clever stuff
  }

  public void crash() {
    // do some clever stuff
  }
}

class B extends A {  

  // Add a method
  public void bar() {
    // do some other stuff
  }

  // Replace a method
  public void foo() {
    // do some other stuff
  }

  // Extend a method
  public void crash() {
    super.crash();
    // do some clever stuff
  }
}
```
