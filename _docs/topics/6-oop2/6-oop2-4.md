## Member Variables

Data that is part of a class make up its *member variables* (ignoring any temporary variables used in class methods).  

Member variables can be `Public` or `Private`. `Public` variables can be read and changed outside the object while only the object itself can change `Private` variables.

```java
public class Foo {
  public int x;
  private int y;

  public void changeY(int newY){
    y = newY;
  }
}

Foo f = new Foo();
f.x = 5; // works
f.y = 4; // doesn't work, y is private
f.changeY(4); // works, changeY is part of Foo so it can change Foo's private variables.
```

## this operator

We can use `this` to access the current object's member variables if necessary

```java
public class Foo {
  public int x;
  private int y;

  public void changeY(int y){
    this.y = y; // this.y is the member variable, y is the parameter
  }
}
```

## Getters & Setters

```java
public class Foo {
  public int x;
  private int y;

  public void setY(int y){
    if ((y>0) && (y<10>)){
      this.y = y; // this.y is the member variable, y is the parameter
    }
  }

  public int getY() { return y; }
}
```
