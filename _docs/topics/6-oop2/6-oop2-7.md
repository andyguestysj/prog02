## Abstraction

Abstraction allows us to create an parent class that declares methods that child classes **must** implement.  

In a parent class you can declare a method to be **abstract**. You don't write the code in the method of the parent, you just declare the shape of it. When you do this you must make the entire class abstract. Any child classes you make from the parent must implement (i.e. complete) the method.  

You cannot make objects from abstract classes.  

```java
public abstract class Shape {
  public int red;
  public int green;
  public int blue;

  public Shape(int red, int green, int blue){
    this.red = red;
    this.green = green; 
    this. blue = blue;
  }

  public void setColour(int red, int green, int blue){
    this.red = red;
    this.green = green; 
    this. blue = blue;
  }

  abstract public double area();
  abstract public double circumference();
}

public class Square extends Shape {

  double width;
  

  public Square(double width, int red, int green, int blue){
    super(red, green, blue);
    this.width = width;
  }

  public double area(){
    return width * width;
  }

  public double circumference(){
    return width + width + width + width;
  }
}

public class Rectangle extends Shape {
  public double positionX;
  public double positionY;
  public double width;
  public double height;
  

  public Rectangle(double posX, double posY, double width, double height){
    super(posX, posY);
    this.width = width;
    this.height = height;
  }

  public double draw(){
    
  }
}

public class Circle extends Shape {
  public double positionX;
  public double positionY;
  public double radius;
  

  public Square(double posX, double posY, double radius){
    super(posX, posY);
    this.radius = radius;
  }

  public double draw(){
    
}
```

Abstract classes and their child classes can be used to make collections of child objects. You can make ArrayLists with objects from different classes in, so long as they all are child classes of the same abstract parent.  

```java
import java.util.ArrayList; // import the ArrayList class

public class Main {
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    ArrayList<Square> squares = new ArrayList<Square>();
    Square newSquare;
    newSquare = new Square(5,6,7);
    squares.add(newSquare);
    newSquare = new Square(1,3,2);
    squares.add(newSquare);
    newSquare = new Square(17,2,13);
    squares.add(newSquare);
    System.out.println(squares);

    // Call each shapes draw() method
    for (Shape s : shapes) {
      s.draw(); 
  }
}
```

We have to be careful. We can use whichever constructors we like but we can only use the methods that are declared in `Shape`, abstract or normal.
