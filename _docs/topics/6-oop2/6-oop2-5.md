## Class Methods

Class methods are methods that are part of a class. Like member variables they can be public or private.

```java
public class Foo {
  public int b;

  public void incrementB()
  {
    b++;
  }

  private void setB(int b)
  {
    this.b = b;
  }
}
```

Class methods can read and change member variables even though they aren't passed to the methods as parameters.

## Overloading Class Methods

**Polymorphism** allows us to create multiple class methods with the same name so long as the parameters are different.

```java
public class Foo {
  public int b;

  private void setB(int b, int c)
  {
    this.b = b * c;
  }

  private void setB(int b)
  {
    this.b = b;
  }
}
```

## Constructors

Constructors are methods that are called automatically when objects are create. We can overload constructors like any other method.

```java
public class Foo {
  public int b;

  public Foo()
  {
    this.b = 4;
  }

  public Foo(int b)
  {
    this.b = b;
  }
}
```


## Variable Parameters

```java
void myGreatMethod(int n)
{
  n = 7;
  System.out.println(n);
}

int p = 4;
myGreatMethod(p);
```
We only change `n` *locally* in `myGreatMethod`. `p` is unchanged.

## Object Parameters

```java
public class Foo {
  public int b;
}

void myGreatMethod(Foo a)
{
  a.b = 7;  
}

Foo p = new Foo();
myGreatMethod(p);
```
We pass a *reference* to an object to the method. This creates a copy of the reference that refers to the same object. By changing the object in `myGreatMethod` we change the object everywhere.
