## Objects

An **object** is a collection of *properties* and *behaviours* that embody a *concept*. Its *properties* are its data, its member variables. It's *behaviours* are what it can do, its class methods.  

## Classes 

Classes are how we define the properties and behaviours an object will have. A *class* is the template or blueprint we use to make objects.  

## Creating An Object

```java
public class Foo {
  public int x;
  public int y;
}

Foo f = new Foo();
```

What just happened?  

A number of things happened in one line `Foo f = new Foo();`  
* `Foo f` - create a label (or *reference*) called `f`  
* `new` - creates a new *object*  
* `Foo()` - using a plan (or *class*) called Foo  
* `f = ..` - attach the *reference* to the *object*  

A *reference* called `f` is created in one place in memory and it *refers* to the *object* which is stored somewhere else in memory.  

![f points to object](https://ysjprog2.netlify.app/assets/img/topics/2oop1/simpleobject1.png)

Above we have `f` the *reference* and the *object* as separate location in memory. We say that `f` *refers to* or is a *reference to* the object. 

## Multiple Objects Of The Same Type

We can create multiple objects of a single class.

```java
public class Foo {
  public int x;
  public int y;
}

Foo f = new Foo();
Foo g = new Foo();
Foo h = new Foo();
```

`f,g,h` are three separate references to three distinct objects.  

## Multiple References To A Single Object

Remember the *references* and the *objects* are different things in memory. It is possible to have *multiple references* all connected to a *single object*.

```java
Foo f = new Foo();
f.x = 42;
f.y = 9;  

Foo g = f;
g.x = 77;
```

![two references to a single object](https://ysjprog2.netlify.app/assets/img/topics/2oop1/simpleobject4.png)

`g.x = 77;`  
* `g` - look in the object labelled `g`  
* `.y` - find its variable `y`  
* `= 77;` - and set it to 77

Since `f` and `g` both *refer* to the same *object*, using either has the same effect.  

## **null** references

What if we have..

```java
class Ostrabagalous {
  int x;
  String y;
}

Ostrabagalous o;
```

What does **o** *refer* to?  

It hasn't been attached to a new *object* by using `= new Ostrabagalous;`. It is basically a blank label that is ready to be attached to an **Ostrabagalous** **object*.  

In Java we say that `o` refers to a **null**.
