## Objects

An **object** is a collection of *properties* and *behaviours* that embody a *concept*. Its *properties* are its data, its member variables. It's *behaviours* are what it can do, its class methods.  

## Classes 

Classes are how we define the properties and behaviours an object will have. A *class* is the template or blueprint we use to make objects.  

## Creating An Object

```java
public class Foo {
  public int x;
  public int y;
}

Foo f = new Foo();
```

What just happened?  

A number of things happened in one line `Foo f = new Foo();`  
* `Foo f` - create a label (or *reference*) called `f`  
* `new` - creates a new *object*  
* `Foo()` - using a plan (or *class*) called Foo  
* `f = ..` - attach the *reference* to the *object*  

A *reference* called `f` is created in one place in memory and it *refers* to the *object* which is stored somewhere else in memory.  

![f points to object](https://ysjprog02.netlify.app/assets/img/topics/2oop1/simpleobject1.png)

Above we have `f` the *reference* and the *object* as separate location in memory. We say that `f` *refers to* or is a *reference to* the object. 

### Multiple Objects Of The Same Type


## Member Variables

Data that is part of a class make up its *member variables* (ignoring any temporary variables used in class methods).  

Member variables can be `Public` or `Private`. `Public` variables can be read and changed outside the object while only the object itself can change `Private` variables.

```java
public class Foo {
  public int x;
  private int y;

  public changeY(int newY){
    y = newY;
  }
}

Foo f = new Foo();
f.x = 5; // works
f.y = 4; // doesn't work, y is private
f.changeY(4); // works, changeY is part of Foo so it can change Foo's private variables.
```

We can use `this` to access the current object's member variables if necessary

```java
public class Foo {
  public int x;
  private int y;

  public changeY(int y){
    this.y = y; // this.y is the member variable, y is the parameter
  }
}
```
