## Principles of Object Orientation
(Adapted/stolen from [freecodecamp.org](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/object-oriented-programming-concepts-21bb035f7260/))  


The four principles of object-oriented programming are **encapsulation**, **abstraction**, **inheritance**, and **polymorphism**.

### Encapsulation
Say we have a program. It has a few logically different objects which communicate with each other — according to the rules defined in the program.

Encapsulation is achieved when each object keeps its state private, inside a class. Other objects don’t have direct access to this state. Instead, they can only call a list of public functions — called methods.

So, the object manages its own state via methods — and no other class can touch it unless explicitly allowed. If you want to communicate with the object, you should use the methods provided.

Let’s say we’re building a tiny Sims game. There are people and there is a cat. They communicate with each other. We want to apply encapsulation, so we encapsulate all “cat” logic into a Cat class. It may look like this:

*You can feed the cat. But you can’t directly change how hungry the cat is*
