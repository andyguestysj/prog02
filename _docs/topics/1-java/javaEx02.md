### Exercise 1 - Create A Project

In this module I will often create a repository with some code in it to start an exercise off. Sometimes you will need to create a project from scratch. This exercise will walk you through this process.  

Since we have the `Project Manager For Java` extension installed this is a painless process. (If you don't have it installed then go back to the exercises for week 1 and get VSCode set up with the extensions!).  

1. Open VSCode.
2. Close all files/projects
3. Open the Explorer in the side bar
4. Click on **Create Java Project**
5. Select "No Build Tools"
6. Select the parent folder you want your project folder to be in
7. Enter a name for your project
8. VSCode will do the rest 
9. Open src/App.java in VSCode 
10. Run it and make sure it works

### Exercise 2 - Variables

1. Using your project from Exercise 1 create the following variables and output them
   1. An integer called `daysPerWeek` with a value of 7
   2. An integer called `numberOfWeeks` with a value of 6
   3. An integer called `totalDays` that uses the previous two variables to calculate the number of days in that many weeks.
   4. A true or false variable called `onHoliday` that is set to false. For this you should output a string that says if you are on holiday or not
   5. A real number called `approxPI` that is set to 3.14. Use it to calculate and output the circumference of a circle with a radius of 3. (Use circumference = 2 * PI * radious)
   6. Strings called
      1. `greetingString` with a value of "Hello"
      2. `introductionString` with a value of "My name is Inigo Montoya"
      3. `reminderString` with a value of "You killed my father"
      4. `threatString` with a value of "Prepare to die!"
      5. and then use them to output "Hello, My name is Inigo Montoya, You killed my father, Prepare to die!"
