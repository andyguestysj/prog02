Each week's course materials will include some learning exercises. These exercises will either be interspersed throughout the material or as a collection of exercises at the end of the material, or both. The exercise format will vary depending on the topic.  

The exercises below should give you a feel for how the exercises will work and hopefully serve as a refresher on some of the material from last semester.  

## Exercises
1. If you don't already have a free replit.com account, please sign up for one now. The replit.com website is here [https://replit.com/](https://replit.com/). There are instructions how to do this at [https://ysjprog02.netlify.app/docs/replit/](https://ysjprog02.netlify.app/docs/replit/).

2. Create a new Java application called **recap1**
  * Create a simple class called **Simple**
    * it should have a member variable `int aNumber = 3;`
    * it should have a method named `outputNumber()` that prints the value in `aNumber` to the screen
  * Create an object of the **Simple** class called `myObject`
  * Use `myObject` to call the `outputNumber()` method.

3. Sometimes I might give you the core of a Java program to start you off. To do this I'll give you the URL of one of my replit.com programs and ask you to **fork** a copy to your own replit.com account. Simply click the link to go to my code and click the fork button at the top of the screen (it looks like <i class="fa fa-code-fork" aria-hidden="true"></i> turned on its side). This will copy the repl to your account for you to work on.  

   These types of exercises will generally have a file called **Instructions.md** which will tell you what you need to do to complete the exercise.

   Fork yourself a copy of **recap2** from [https://replit.com/@andyguest/recap2#Main.java](https://replit.com/@andyguest/recap2#Main.java). There is an **Instructions.md** file that covers the exercise.
