It is good coding practice to include comments in your code, Java gives us the standard ways of doing this.  

```java
/* Block comments begin with slash asterisk

   and end with asterisk slash */

class Comments {
  // line comments start with slash slash and run to the end of the line
  int a=5; // they can be added after code too
}
```
