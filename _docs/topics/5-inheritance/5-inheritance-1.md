## Recap

So far we have covered
* **Classes & Objects**
* **Member Variables**
* **Object Creation**
* **Class Methods** and **Constructors**
* **Scope** of variables and member variables in particular
* **Public** and **Private** keywords
* **Encapsulation**

We have two major components of OOP left to look at, inheritance and abstraction. We'll start with inheritance.
