We will be using assorted software and programming tools in this module. This page will link to resources for the software and tools.  

## Moodle

The Moodle page for this module is the key information source. It will have the assessment brief, deadlines, submission information and assessment feedback.  

If there are any contradictions between Moodle and other sources the Moodle information should be considered correct. 

## Website

The content for the module will be provided through the Programming 02 webpage [https://ysjprog02.netlify.app/](https://ysjprog02.netlify.app/). Moodle isn't suitable for presenting the information, videos and tutorials required. There is a link to the webpage on Moodle.

## eMail

eMail is the primary communication method for this module. Please check your email each week day so we can update you on any changes. I advise checking your email shortly before any timetabled session in case of changes.  

The best way to contact me is via [email](mailto:a.guest@yorksj.ac.uk). You can also message me through MS Teams.

## Microsoft Teams

MS Teams can be used for tutorials and may be used to give lectures should Covid restrictions come in to place.   

## Visual Studio Code
Our editor of choice this year is Visual Studio Code. VSC is installed on all our machines. It is a versatile, lightweight, easily extendable editor. It can be setup to work with multiple programming languages and to intergrate directly with the gitlab servers.  

Instructions for installing and setting up Visual Studio Code are available here.

## replit.com
We used replit.com last year to help us during the covid pandemic. replit.com can be used again this year but it is not required.

You can sign up for a replit.com account for free at https://replit.com/. I recommend you do so using your York St John email account address.

The replit.com page on this site (under the Reference section) contains instructions and tips for using replit.com.

## GitLab

The Computing department has its own GitLab server. I will be using this to provide you with code examples and starting points for exercises. You will need to ensure you have access to the GitLab server. Your **username is your YSJ username** but your **password is your Computing network password**.  

The web page interface for GitLab is at [https://git.ysjcs.net:8888/users/sign_in](https://git.ysjcs.net:8888/users/sign_in).  

If you cannot log in, please email Matt Baxter to reset your password.  

Instructions for using GitLab can be found here.
