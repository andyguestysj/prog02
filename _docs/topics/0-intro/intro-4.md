With the ongoing Covid pandemic teaching has had to change from the standard classroom based lecture and labs approach. 

The lecture for this module is on Monday mornings from 10am - 11.30am. Everyone will attend this lecture.

The lab sessions for this module are on Thursdays. You have been assigned to a lab from 1000 - 1200 or from 1300-1500.

The lecture material and lab exercises will be posted to the module website [https://ysjprog2.netlify.app/](https://ysjprog2.netlify.app/). 

The Moodle page will contain a link to this website.
