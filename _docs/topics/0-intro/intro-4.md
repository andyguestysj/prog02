With the ongoing Covid pandemic teaching has had to change from the standard classroom based lecture and labs approach. You are required to attend the online lab sessions on Thursdays at 10-12 or 13-15 depending on the class you were allocated to. Please attend that class and do not switch. If you need to change class please contact me and we will see what can be managed.  

For this module there will be no formal lectures presented live to the class. Instead the course material will be provided each week in advance of the scheduled lab session.  

This website will contain all the materials and videos along with learning exercises for you to do while going through them. Each week I will also upload a Lab exercises page for you to work on during the lab sessions.  

The lab sessions are for you to ask questions about any of the course material or learning exercises, and for you to get the chance to work on some more substantial exercises using what you've learned.  

**You** are expected to *read through the materials, watch any videos and work through any exercises*. You will need to do this to keep up with the material and be able to work on the lab exercises each week.
