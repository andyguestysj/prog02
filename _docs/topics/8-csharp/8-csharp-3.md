## Similarities Between C # and Java
* **Object-Oriented**: Both languages are object-oriented and hence support concepts like encapsulation, polymorphism, inheritance, and more.
* **Dependence from C and C++**: C and C++ are a superset to both Java and C#.
* **Intermediate Language Code Generation**: Java compiler and C# compilers both generate an intermediate language code after compilation. C# compiler generates Microsoft Intermediate Language (MSIL), whereas Java compiler generates Java bytecode.
* **Advance Features**: Both languages include advanced features like garbage collection.
* **Syntax**: Both languages are syntactically similar.

## Key Differences Between C# and Java
* **Runtime Environment**: Java runs on JRE(Java Runtime Environment), whereas C# runs on CLR(Common Language Runtime).
* **Programming Paradigm**: Java is a strictly object-oriented language whereas C# is object-oriented as well as functional, strongly typed, and component-oriented.
* **Operator Overloading**: Java doesn't support operator overloading, whereas C# supports operator overloading for multiple operators.
* **Pointers**: Java does not support pointers, whereas C# supports pointers only in unsafe mode.

We'll talk much more about pointers in Programming 03.
