## Python

Python is a high-level, interpreted, interactive and object-oriented scripting language. Python is designed to be highly readable. It uses English keywords frequently where as other languages use punctuation, and it has fewer syntactical constructions than other languages.

* **Python is Interpreted** − Python is processed at runtime by the interpreter. You do not need to compile your program before executing it. This is similar to PERL and PHP.

* **Python is Interactive** − You can actually sit at a Python prompt and interact with the interpreter directly to write your programs.

* **Python is Object-Oriented** − Python supports Object-Oriented style or technique of programming that encapsulates code within objects.

* **Python is a Beginner's Language** − Python is a great language for the beginner-level programmers and supports the development of a wide range of applications from simple text processing to WWW browsers to games. Don't let this fool you, Python is a good language for beginners and it is a good language for everyone else too. 

Python is very quick to work with. It is very good for rapidly developing prototypes.  

Python also has a wide range of freely available and easily added extensions that cover almost everything you could want.
