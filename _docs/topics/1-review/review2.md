In this module we will take topic 6 **Classes & Objects** and delve deeper, a lot deeper in to object oriented programming. Along the way we will probably use everything else you learned in Programming 01. Programming isn't like a lot of other subjects, when you complete a module you can't put it aside and say *"that is done, don't need to think about that anymore"*. Programming builds on, and continues to use, the knowledge learned at every previous stage. Hopefully, as you progress and gain more knowledge and experience, the early stuff becomes second nature and you'll stop having to think about how to use a for loop or an array. You will still be using that knowledge but it won't be a struggle. And that's a good thing because there will be plenty of new stuff to struggle with!  

Each week, after the lab session, I'll upload the material for you to work through before the next session. It is important you do this so you can learn the material needed for the next session and so that if you do have problems with it you can ask in the next session.  

Each week's course materials will include some learning exercises. These exercises will either be interspersed throughout the material or as a collection of exercises at the end of the material, or both. The exercise format will vary depending on the topic.
