## Programming 02

In this module we will take topic 6 **Classes & Objects** and delve deeper, a lot deeper in to object oriented programming. Along the way we will probably use everything else you learned in Programming 01. Programming isn't like a lot of other subjects, when you complete a module you can't put it aside and say *"that is done, don't need to think about that anymore"*. Programming builds on, and continues to use, the knowledge learned at every previous stage. Hopefully, as you progress and gain more knowledge and experience, the early stuff becomes second nature and you'll stop having to think about how to use a for loop or an array. You will still be using that knowledge but it won't be a struggle. And that's a good thing because there will be plenty of new stuff to struggle with!  

Each week, after the lab session, I'll upload the material for you to work through before the next session. It is important you do this so you can learn the material needed for the next session and so that if you do have problems with it you can ask in the next session.  

Each week's course materials will include some learning exercises. These exercises will either be interspersed throughout the material or as a collection of exercises at the end of the material, or both. The exercise format will vary depending on the topic.  

The exercises below should give you a feel for how the exercises will work and hopefully serve as a refresher on some of the material from last semester.  

## Exercises
1. If you don't already have a free repl.it account, please sign up for one now. The repl.it website is here [https://repl.it/](https://repl.it/). There are instructions how to do this at [https://ysjprog02.netlify.app/docs/replit/](https://ysjprog02.netlify.app/docs/replit/).

2. Create a new Java application called **recap1**
  * Create a simple class called **Simple**
    * it should have a member variable `int aNumber = 3;`
    * it should have a method named `outputNumber()` that prints the value in `aNumber` to the screen
  * Create an object of the **Simple** class called `myObject`
  * Use `myObject` to call the `outputNumber()` method.

3. Sometimes I might give you the core of a Java program to start you off. To do this I'll give you the URL of one of my repl.it programs and ask you to **fork** a copy to your own repl.it account. Simply click the link to go to my code and click the fork button at the top of the screen (it looks like <i class="fa fa-code-fork" aria-hidden="true"></i> turned on its side). This will copy the repl to your account for you to work on.
