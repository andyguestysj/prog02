A **use case diagram** at its simplest is a representation of a user's interaction with the system that shows the relationship between the user and the different use cases in which the user is involved. A use case diagram can identify the different types of users of a system and the different use cases and will often be accompanied by other types of diagrams as well. The use cases are represented by either circles or ellipses.

*Use Case Diagram Example* 

Use case diagrams are used to gather the requirements of a system including internal and external influences. These requirements are mostly design requirements. Hence, when a system is analysed to gather its functionalities, use cases are prepared and actors are identified.

When the initial task is complete, use case diagrams are modelled to present the outside view.

In brief, the purposes of use case diagrams can be said to be as follows âˆ’
* Used to gather the requirements of a system.
* Used to get an outside view of a system.
* Identify the external and internal factors influencing the system.
* Show the interaction among the requirements are actors.

## Use Case Diagram Components

### Use-case

Use cases are used to represent high-level functionalities and how the user will handle the system. A use case represents a distinct functionality of a system, a component, a package, or a class. It is denoted by an oval shape with the name of a use case written inside the oval shape.

### Actor

The actor is an entity that interacts with the system. A user is the best example of an actor. An actor is an entity that initiates the use case from outside the scope of a use case. It can be any element that can trigger an interaction with the use case. One actor can be associated with multiple use cases in the system

### Associations

Associations between actors and use cases or between use cases are indicated by lines connecting the two.
