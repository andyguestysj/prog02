There are a number of UML diagramming tools available. At the bottom of this page are links to a number of them.  

We're going to look at **PlantUML**. 

## PlantUML

[PlantUML](https://plantuml.com/) is a simple scripting language that supports UML diagrams. Most of the UML diagrams on these pages have been created using PlantUML. 

PlantUML is available in a number of ways. 

* It can be installed an run from the command line
* It is available as a plugin for [Eclipse](https://plantuml.com/eclipse) and [Visual Studio Code](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=jebbs.plantuml). 
* There are web pages that can be used to edit PlantUML and generate diagrams ([https://www.planttext.com/](https://www.planttext.com/), [https://plantuml-editor.kkeisuke.com/](https://plantuml-editor.kkeisuke.com/)) 

## PlantText
This page assumes you are using PlantUML at the [https://www.planttext.com/](https://www.planttext.com/) webpage.

PlantText has a simple interface.

The large area on the left is used to enter the PlantUML script. On the right a live update preview of the diagram is shown. 

Above a drop down list has a number of example scripts.

You can save/load your PlantUML by using the File Manager button.

You can save the images generated by clicking on the PNG link below the preview image.

## UML Diagrams & PlantUML

The [PlantUML Website](https://plantuml.com/) holds lots of information on how to use PlantUML to generate UML diagrams. Across the top of the web page is a menu bar with links to the specific guides for different types of diagrams.
