There are a number of UML diagramming tools available. At the bottom of this page are links to a number of them.  

We're going to look at **PlantUML**. 

## PlantUML

[PlantUML](https://plantuml.com/) is a simple scripting language that supports UML diagrams. Most of the UML diagrams on these pages have been created using PlantUML. 

PlantUML is available in a number of ways. 

* It can be installed an run from the command line
* It is available as a plugin for [Eclipse](https://plantuml.com/eclipse) and [Visual Studio Code](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=jebbs.plantuml). 
* There are web pages that can be used to edit PlantUML and generate diagrams ([https://www.planttext.com/](https://www.planttext.com/), [https://plantuml-editor.kkeisuke.com/](https://plantuml-editor.kkeisuke.com/)) 

## PlantText
This page assumes you are using PlantUML at the [https://www.planttext.com/](https://www.planttext.com/) webpage.

PlantText has a simple interface.

The large area on the left is used to enter the PlantUML script. On the right a live update preview of the diagram is shown. 

Above a drop down list has a number of example scripts.

You can save/load your PlantUML by using the File Manager button.

You can save the images generated by clicking on the PNG link below the preview image.

## UML Diagrams & PlantUML

The [PlantUML Website](https://plantuml.com/) holds lots of information on how to use PlantUML to generate UML diagrams. Across the top of the web page is a menu bar with links to the specific guides for different types of diagrams.

### The Basics

Every PlantUML script begins with `@startuml` and ends with `@enduml`.

By default the diagrams generated and coloured and use icons rather than symbols for accessibility. You can turn the images black and white with the line `skinparam monochrome true` and switch to the traditional accessibility symbols with `skinparam classAttributeIconSize 0`. The line `skinparam groupInheritance 2` makes the way inheritance is shown a little tidier.

I recommend you use the code below as the basis of all your PlantUML scripts.

```console
@startuml
skinparam monochrome true
skinparam classAttributeIconSize 0
skinparam groupInheritance 2

' insert code here

@enduml
```

Line comments begin with a `'` and block comments are `/'` to `'/`.

## Class Diagrams

The guide for class diagrams is [here](https://plantuml.com/class-diagram). 


A class can be added to a diagram with the line
<div class="row">
  <div class="col-md-6" markdown="1">

```console
class className
```


  </div>
  <div class="col-md-6" markdown="1">  
 
 ![Basic](https://ysjprog02.netlify.app/assets/img/topics/7uml/basicclass.png)
*Basic Class* 

  </div>  
</div>
This will add a basic class box without any member variables or methods.


Member variables and class methods can be added as shown below.
<div class="row">
  <div class="col-md-6" markdown="1">

```console
class className {
  +memberVariableName1 : variableType
  +method()
}
```

  </div>
  <div class="col-md-6" markdown="1">  
 
 ![Class with variables and methods](https://ysjprog02.netlify.app/assets/img/topics/7uml/fullclass.png)
*Class with variables and methods* 

  </div>  
</div>
The symbols `+`, `-`, `#`, `~` can be added before the member variables or methods to show accessibility.  

You can place the `{abstract}` modifier before any class name, variable or method to make it abstract.


<div class="row">
  <div class="col-md-6" markdown="1">

  ```console
@startuml
skinparam monochrome true
skinparam classAttributeIconSize 0
skinparam groupInheritance 2
class Person
together {
  class Student
  class Lecturer
}
Person <|-- Student
Person <|-- Lecturer
@enduml
  ```


  </div>
  <div class="col-md-6" markdown="1">  
 
 ![Inheritance](https://ysjprog02.netlify.app/assets/img/topics/7uml/inheritance.png)
*Inheritance* 

  </div>
