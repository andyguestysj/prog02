## Formative Assessment
1. Fork yourself a copy of **javaComplex** from [https://repl.it/@andyguest/javaComplex](https://repl.it/@andyguest/javaComplex). There is an **Instructions.md** file that covers the exercise. This is a formative exercise. If you complete it and share your solution with me before 12 noon on 01/03/2021 I will mark it and give you feedback on it (in repl).

**Note this assessment is not part of your final mark for the module** It is formative which means it is there to give you some feedback on how well you are progressing. I will upload a solution to this exercise here once I have marked and given feedback to any submissions of this exercise.
