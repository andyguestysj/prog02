### Overview

The assessment for this module consists of three parts. Part one is an essay on Object Oriented concepts, Part two is a design exercise, to come up with a design for a code challenge and to explain it. Part three is to write code that implements that design. Each of these parts is described in the sections below, each is worth one third of the overall mark for this module.

### 1 – Essay – Principles of Object Oriented Programming (1000 words) 

Write an essay describing the principles of Object Oriented programming. You should describe what classes and objects are. You should also explain the fundamental principles of OOP (polymorphism, abstraction, encapsulation, inheritance). 
You should reference any external sources you use, and quotations should be kept short and be used to illustrate something you have described in your own words.

### 2 – Design A Zoo

Imagine a virtual York St John zoo. We want to have a variety of animals from around the world and show them off. We want to have a mixture of mammals, birds, fish and reptiles. We want to have animals from deserts, arctic, jungle, forests, etc. We need to be able to organise them by the type of animal they are. We want to be able to ask questions like “what does each animal eat?”, “what animals do we have from a specific environment”

Create a design for a zoo application. You should design the classes required to implement a system for tracking animals in a zoo. Use inheritance to distinguish between the various types of animals. You will need to store information on each animal such as food type, environment, description, etc.

Your design should include a class diagram showing the classes you would create, the relationships between them. Showing the member variables and methods on this diagram would be good.

### 3 – Zoo Application

Take your design from part 2 and implement it in Java. 

Your application should implement the following features
1.	Use an ArrayList to store a list of all animals in the zoo
2.	Display the details of an individual animal
3.	Display the details of each animal in an ArrayList
4.	Generate an ArrayList of all animals of a particular type
5.	Output “Food required” for all animals in an ArrayList (might be all animals, by be a list from 4)
6.	Output all animals from a specific environment.
