[Video Brief]()  

## Little Lucy's Fabledrealm

Clone yourself a copy of **javaAssessEx4** from [https://git.ysjcs.net:8888/a.guest/javaassessex4.git](https://git.ysjcs.net:8888/a.guest/javaassessex4.git). There is an **Instructions.md** file that covers the exercise. (The instructions are repeated below).

Little Lucy is running a fantasy roleplaying game for her friends. She's a busy computer science student who doesn't have time to think up new adventure ideas every week so she has created an app to generate random adventures for her. Lucy needs your help in documenting the application design.  

### Assessment Exercise 4

You need to create UML diagrams for this project.

* **Class Diagram** showing the classes in the application and their relationships to each other. Remember a class diagram shows the class structure as it exists throughout the life of the application. It does not show objects.
* **Object Diagram** just after the application generates this weeks adventure. (i.e. just after line 6 in App.java finishes running). This diagram should show all the objects that exist at that point and how they are linked to each other.  
* **Sequence Diagram** showing the objects and methods involved in the line of code `Adventure thisWeek = generator.generateAdventure();` (line 8 in App.java).

### Marking

25 marks are available for this exercise. This breaks down as follows.  

* Class Diagram - 10 d
* Object Diagram - 5 marks
* Sequence Diagram - 10 marks

## Submission

Your project should be uploaded to your gitlab account and you should submit a link to the gitlab project, alongside the rest of the assessment, through moodle, by 12 noon 16/05/22.
