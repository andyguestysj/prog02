### Visual Studio Code

We're going to be programming in the Java programming language in this module. 

Visual Studio Code (VSC) is an text based code editor. It is available for Windows, Linux and Mac from [https://code.visualstudio.com/](https://code.visualstudio.com/).  

VSC has many extensions available for it, making it usable as an editor for most programming languages, scripting and most other things.  

We'll be using the extensions listed below
* Extension Pack For Java
* Code Runner
* PlantUML
  

**Installing Extensions**

When you have VSC open click on the Extensions button in the icon bar down the left hand side of the screen.  

<centre>        
    <img src="{{ "/assets/img/vsc-ext.png" | relative_url }}" alt="VSC Button Bar" class="img-responsive">
</centre>
<BR>
<centre>        
    <img src="{{ "/assets/img/ext-btn.png" | relative_url }}" alt="VSC Button Bar - Extension Button" class="img-responsive">
</centre>

This will open up the Extensions side bar.  

<centre>        
    <img src="{{ "/assets/img/ext-bar.png" | relative_url }}" alt="VSC - Extension Bar" class="img-responsive">
</centre>

Type the name of the extension you want to install in the text box at the top of the Extension Bar and click the blue install button for the extension.
